# Developers, welcome

This documentation was made for developers willing to deploy ONCHAINID contracts, interact
 with them or
 build an application integrating  ONCHAINID. In order to be complete it also introduces the developers with the
  various roles involved in the ecosystem and the way they interact with each other. 
 
 The documentation is separated in different sections : 
 
- The **Claim Issuers** section is introducing the role of claim issuer and the different responsibilities of this
  role as well as the different ways to integrate ONCHAINID if you are willing to become a claim issuer;
- The **Information Providers** section is introducing the role of information providers in the ecosystem and the
   responsibilities of the latter, it also describes how the information providers can integrate the ONCHAINID
    ecosystem, technically speaking;
- The **Integration** section is a more general section about general integration of ONCHAINID in various
    applications, it contains examples of possible integrations and how to correctly integrate; 
- Finally the **SDK** section is describing in details the SDK that is provided to interact with smart contracts
 deployed on the blockchain. 
 
The **SDK** section is definitely the most meaningful section for developers already familiar with ONCHAINID concepts.
