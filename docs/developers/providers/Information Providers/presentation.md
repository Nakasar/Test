# Introduction to Information Providers

An **Information Provider** is a service that stores pieces of information about an identity without publishing them to the Blockchain, by opposition to Claims that are stored on-chain.

The identity is identified by its unique smart contract address.
The owner of the identity should always be able to access and manage its data as long as he/she can sign
messages with a MANAGEMENT of the Identity.

An Information Provider must provide the following features:

- Store information about an Identity.
